# AWS ECS Go Project

This project demonstrates how to use AWS SDK v2 for Go with ECS (Elastic Container Service) for container management.

## üöÄ Quick Start

```bash
# Run the application
go run main.go
```

## üì¶ Installed Packages

- **ECS Client**: `github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/service/ecs`
- **AWS Config**: `github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/config`

## üîß AWS Configuration

To use the AWS services, you need to configure your AWS credentials and region. Here are the options:

### Option 1: Environment Variables
```bash
# export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="your-access-key"
# export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="your-secret-key"
export AWS_REGION="eu-west-1"
```

### Option 2: AWS Credentials File
Create `~/.aws/credentials`:
```ini
[default]
aws_access_key_id = your-access-key
aws_secret_access_key = your-secret-key
```

Create `~/.aws/config`:
```ini
[default]
region = us-west-2
output = json
```

### Option 3: AWS CLI
```bash
# Install AWS CLI first, then configure
aws configure
```

### Option 4: IAM Roles (for EC2/ECS)
If running on AWS infrastructure, you can use IAM roles attached to your EC2 instance or ECS task.

## üîç What the Application Does

1. **Loads AWS Configuration** - Automatically detects credentials from environment, files, or IAM roles
2. **Creates ECS Client** - Sets up client for Elastic Container Service operations
3. **Lists ECS Clusters** - Demonstrates fetching ECS clusters in your account
4. **Describes Clusters** - Gets detailed information about each cluster
5. **Lists Containers** - Shows all running containers in each cluster with task details
6. **Writes Configuration** - Outputs setup details and operation logs to `out.txt`

## üõ†Ô∏è Available Operations

### ECS Operations
- List clusters
- Describe clusters with detailed information
- List running tasks in each cluster
- Show all containers with runtime details
- Display network bindings and interfaces

## üìö Documentation

- [ECS SDK Documentation](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/service/ecs)
- [AWS SDK v2 for Go](https://aws.github.io/aws-sdk-go-v2/docs/)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes

- The application will show credential errors if AWS credentials are not configured
- Make sure you have appropriate IAM permissions for ECS operations
- The application uses the default AWS region from your configuration

## üîê Required IAM Permissions

For full functionality, your AWS credentials need these permissions:

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "ecs:ListClusters",
                "ecs:DescribeClusters",
                "ecs:ListTasks",
                "ecs:DescribeTasks"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
```
